Awesome work here. I'd like to talk with you a little bit to learn some more about Kelly Williams, and your ideas for her site. This will make a great PWP, and I'm looking forward to seeing it take shape. Adding a small gallery to display her works is certainly within scope as well. Your HTML and CSS looks good overall. There are some issues with your GitHub repository however. Overall, nice work! Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Edits/Suggestions
There are some issues with your GitHub repository:
- OH NO! There's a .idea folder in there! You'll need to delete this repo and re-create the project. Talk to any one of us (me, Skyler, or Dylan) if you need any guidance. No need to re-write any code, just copy/paste it from the current project.
- Move your CSS directory inside /public_html
- I don't see any of your image files in GitHub. Be sure all your image files are added to git and committed and pushed to your repository.
- Link to your internal resources (images, stylesheets) using relative links instead of absolute links. They will look something like this: <code>&lt;img src="img/allix.jpg" alt="Allix Cohen"&gt;</code>
