			<p> Allix is a goal oriented and task-minded. She wants to iron out the big concrete details quickly so she
			can handle the little details where her skillset shines the brightest. She’s less concerned about putting her
			personal stamp on the event she’s throwing and would rather bring in artists who are easy to work with.</p>

			<div class="goals">
					<p>Allix is a 29 year old curator for a medium-sized non-profit studio and gallery space in a small
				metropolitan city in the American west. She’s only lived in this particular city for a few years
				and she’s still getting to know the local art community, but she has assisted with the curation and
				planning of a small handful of well-received shows. Recently, the gallery director has taken an indefinite
				leave of absence and Allix has been tasked with curating a showcase featuring local female artists. She
				has turned to her Facebook friends and Twitter followers for suggestions, and overwhelmed with responses,
				has decided that she will pick candidates based on two qualifications, whoever is easiest to contact and
				book, and whoever has work she enjoys, in that order. While she would prefer to go with candidates whose
				work she enjoys, she is more likely choose the artists who seem the easiest to work with. She will primarily
				be doing much of her work on the show case on the desktop supplied by the gallery, but may also peruse
				possible candidates on the go with her iPad or iPhone+.</p>
